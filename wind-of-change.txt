Wind of change, Scorpions

Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
